##About Me
<hr>
I am currently in the process of obtaining a degree in Civil Engineering. While the degree is very interesting I still strive to learn things such as web development and game development. Though I am far from an artist of any kind, what I do end up making in either game or web development tends to have sharp edges in the beauty department. Well in all honesty my creations have sharp edges in every department, but fun none the less to create.

##About This Site
<hr>
Not only is this site the foundation of my knowledge in web development it will be used to track my other projects in the future. I wish to create an easy to use template that others may use to build their sites off of. Because an easy to use template is the end goal, the process in which the site was created became a bit complected in the beginning. Though I do intend to continue to round edges on this site while I work on other projects.

##More About What I Do In My Spare time
<hr>
I have an absurd obsession with video games, mostly with survival based games like Rust. I do spend most of my time on Rust, but when the servers break I will play just about anything. I make game guides on youtube, and stream to twitch(hopefully youtube soon when they add more features.)
